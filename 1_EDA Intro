### ðŸ”§ **ETL â€“ Extract, Transform, Load**

1. **Extract**

   * Pull data from the original booking database (including third-party inputs).
   * Store it in a staging environment.

2. **Transform**

   * Handle missing values (e.g., imputation or removal).
   * Convert incorrect data types (e.g., date fields, numeric formats).
   * Normalize data (e.g., city names, hotel types).
   * Aggregate and restructure tables for analysis readiness.
   * Apply business logic (e.g., categorize bookings, calculate revenue).

3. **Load**

   * Load the cleaned and transformed data into a new analytical database or data warehouse.
   * This serves as the **single source of truth** for business intelligence and reporting.
